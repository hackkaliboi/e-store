# Next Steps

You've successfully configured your Supabase backend with the application. Here are the next steps to get everything working:

## 1. Create the Database Tables

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/njovhfjtdjhwvkybvpqo
2. Navigate to the SQL editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase_setup.sql` into the editor
4. Run the script to create all necessary tables and insert sample data

## 2. Set up Authentication

1. In the Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Settings
2. Make sure "Enable email signup" is turned on
3. You can optionally configure email templates for a better user experience

## 3. Create an Admin Account

1. Visit the admin login page: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
2. Click on "Don't have an account? Contact the system administrator."
3. For now, you can create an account by using the sign up functionality in your application
4. Later, you can implement a more secure admin creation process

## 4. Test the Application

After running the SQL script, you can test the application:

1. Visit the main site: http://localhost:3000
2. Visit the admin panel: http://localhost:3000/admin

You should now see the sample products displayed on the site and be able to manage them in the admin panel.

## 5. Using the Admin Panel

In the admin panel, you can:
- View dashboard statistics
- Add new products
- Edit existing products
- Delete products (try this functionality with the sample data)
- Update store settings

All data will be stored in your Supabase database rather than localStorage.

## 6. Customizing Your Store

You can customize your store by:
- Adding your own product images
- Modifying product details
- Updating store settings in the settings page
- Adding more products through the admin panel

## 7. Security Note

For production use, you should:
1. Set up proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
2. Use service role keys for admin operations
3. Implement proper authentication for the admin panel
4. Set up email confirmation for new users
5. Create an admin role table as shown in `supabase_setup.sql`
